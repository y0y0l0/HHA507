1. **Data Storytelling with Tableau Public** (Approx. 50 minutes) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
   <https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data-storytelling-tableau-public>

2. **The Tableau Data Model** (Approx. 35 minutes) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   <https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/the-tableau-data-model>

You must complete each module and earn the associated **Trailhead credit (badge/points)**.

## Instructions

### 1. Set Up Accounts

1. Go to **Trailhead**: <https://trailhead.salesforce.com>  
   - Create or sign in with an account that you are comfortable using for coursework.
2. Go to **Tableau Public**: <https://public.tableau.com>  
   - Create a free Tableau Public account (or sign in if you already have one). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
   - Confirm you can access your **profile** and create/save vizzes.

---

### 2. Complete the Two Trailhead Modules

Complete both modules listed above:

- **Data Storytelling with Tableau Public**
- **The Tableau Data Model**

For each module:

- Work through all units and interactive “hands-on challenge” activities.
- Ensure the module shows as **completed** in your Trailhead profile and that you have received the corresponding **badge/points**.

---

### 3. Create and Publish a Tableau Public Visualization

Using **Tableau Public**:

1. Choose a **non-sensitive dataset** (no real PHI/PII). Preferably:
   - A healthcare or health-adjacent dataset (e.g., hospital admissions, public health stats, fitness/wellness, demographics), **or**
   - A public dataset of your choice (e.g., sports, social determinants, Great British Bake Off example used in Trailhead). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
2. Build **one** basic viz or small dashboard that:
   - Tells a simple, clear **data story** (e.g., “Admissions have increased in X group”, “Readmissions vary by age group”).
   - Uses at least **two different visual elements** (e.g., bar chart + line chart, map + bar chart, etc.).
3. **Publish** the viz to your Tableau Public profile.
4. Copy the **public URL** of your visualization.

### 4. Capture Evidence of Completion

Collect the following:

1. **Trailhead Evidence stored in images/**
   - From your Trailhead profile or module pages:
     - Take a **screenshot** showing:
       - Your **name**
       - The **module title**
       - The completion status and/or badge/points for:
         - *Data Storytelling with Tableau Public*
         - *The Tableau Data Model*
   - Save these in image files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`).
   *** Screenshots and Links: ***
     - link to Data Story Telling Badge: ![Data Story Telling With Tableau Public Bandge](/images/DataStorytellingWithTableauPublicBadge.png)
     - link to Tableau Data Model Badge: ![The Tableau Data Model Badge](/images/TheTableauDataModelBadge.png)
     - link to Trail Head Badge Summary: ![Trail Head Badge Summary](/images/TrailHeadBadgeSummary.png)
     - link to trailhead profile: <https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazer/tpyrcg1vfqnm18tf7n>

2. **Tableau Public Viz Evidence**
   - Go to your published viz on Tableau Public.
   - Take a **screenshot** of the visualization page showing:
     - The **viz itself**
     - Your **author name** and viz title.
   - Copy the **shareable URL** of the viz.

---

### 5. GitHub Submission Requirements (`tableau_trailhead_basics`)

1. Create a new **public GitHub repository** named: `tableau_trailhead_basics`.

2. In this repository:

   - Add a `README.md` file.
   - Create an `images/` folder (or similar) and upload:
     - Screenshot(s) showing completion of:
       - Data Storytelling with Tableau Public
       - The Tableau Data Model
     - Screenshot of your Tableau Public visualization.

3. In `README.md`, include:

   1. **Evidence Section**
      - Embedded images of:
        - The two completed Trailhead modules.
        - Your Tableau Public viz.  
      - The **public URL** to your Tableau Public viz.
      link to Tableau Public Viz: <https://public.tableau.com/authoring/SampleStudentStressFactorsVizz/StudentStressFactorsDashboard#1>

   2. **Short Written Reflection (4–6 sentences total)**  
      Address all of the following in a single concise paragraph:
       **Dataset:**
       link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wardabilal/student-stress-analysis?select=Student+Stress+Factors.csv
       path = kagglehub.dataset_download("wardabilal/student-stress-analysis")
       Copy of the dataset used in the visualization is attached in the repository ![Trail Head Badge Summary](/data/Student_Stress_Factors.csv)
       
      - **Data Storytelling:**  
        One principle or best practice from *Data Storytelling with Tableau Public* that you found most important, and how it shaped the viz you created. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
        
        **Data Model:**  
        One key concept from *The Tableau Data Model* (e.g., relationships vs joins, working with multiple tables) and why it matters when working with real-world datasets. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
        - 
      - **Healthcare Scenario:**  
        A brief healthcare-specific example where using Tableau’s data model and visual storytelling would be useful (e.g., tracking patient outcomes across multiple tables such as visits, labs, and diagnoses) and why Tableau is a good fit.

      - **Below is the reflection paragraph:**
      ***One important area in data storytelling is to first understand the data and audience, and define the specific question you want answered.The storytelling model allows us to present a hyper-focused presentation of our data analysis in a structured, sequential order.This helps create a more strategic approach in presenting our visualizations rather than just throwing in random charts and graphs.***
      ***A key takeaway from the Tableau Data Model module is the concept of measures and dimensions.Measures are quantitative data fields that can be aggregated and analyzed across different dimensions.Understanding these differences helps in structuring the data correctly for more meaningful visualizations.***
      ***Tableau's data dashboards are useful in tracking patient outcomes across multiple facets such as infections, admissions, labs, and diagnoses. Tableau's quick and easy integrate of diverse range of datasets, enabling healthcare professionals to create complex visualizations to analyze complex relationships and trends effectively.This could also be useful in tracking KPIs across different health areas and hospital departments to ensure quality of care and operationalefficiency. (e.g., monitoring readmission rates, infection rates, patient satisfaction scores across various demographics and time periods).***
      **Moreover, storytelling-driven visualizations can present complex data trends and insights in an intentional way, that can help deepen decision-making and operational efficiency and understanding.***
      


4. Submit the **GitHub repository URL** in the course LMS for grading.
